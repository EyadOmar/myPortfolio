          I was born in Egypt in the year 2000.My father got me my first
          computer when I was nine years old, and I've been obsessed with
          computers ever since. at 2019, I enrolled at
          <a href="https://www.mti.edu.eg/faculty/2/computing" target="_blank">
            MTI's computer science faculty
          </a>
          .I graduated in 2023 with a 3.6 GPA. Of course, I am grateful to my
          college for teaching the fundamentals of computer science, but what
          has truly defined me is my self-study in front end development since
          2021. I've built dozens of websites using various tools and am ready
          to make more.
