At 2019, I enrolled at MTI's computer science faculty .I graduated in 2023 with a 3.6 GPA. Of course, I am grateful to my college for teaching the fundamentals of computer science, but what has truly defined me is my self-study in front end development since 2021. I've built dozens of websites using various tools and am eager to build more.",
